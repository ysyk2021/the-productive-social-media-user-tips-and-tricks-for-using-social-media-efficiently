### Prioritizing Platforms

Not all social media platforms are created equal, and productive social media use involves prioritizing the platforms that are most relevant and effective for achieving your goals.

### Being Mindful of Time Spent

Finally, productive social media use involves being mindful of the time and energy spent on social media. This means setting limits for how much time you spend on these platforms each day, and being intentional about how you use that time.
